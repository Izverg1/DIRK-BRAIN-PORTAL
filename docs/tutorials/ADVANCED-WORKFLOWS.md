# Advanced Workflows in DIRK BRAIN Portal

This tutorial delves into more advanced functionalities of the DIRK BRAIN Portal, focusing on complex task orchestration, real-time monitoring, and deployment strategies.

## 1. Orchestrating Complex Tasks

Beyond simple task decomposition, the GOD Mode Orchestrator can handle multi-faceted requirements by leveraging its NLP and ML capabilities.

### 1.1 Decomposing a Full-Stack Application

Let's try a more complex scenario. Ensure your backend is running.

1.  **Enable Listening:** Activate the voice listening feature in the frontend.
2.  **Speak the Task:** Say the following command:
    *   "Analyze this build a full-stack React app with authentication and real-time chat requirement."
3.  **Observe Detailed Breakdown:** In the backend console, you will observe a more intricate task breakdown, including:
    *   **Subtasks:** A comprehensive list of subtasks required for a full-stack application.
    *   **Dependencies:** Explicit dependencies between subtasks, ensuring correct execution order.
    *   **Assigned Agents:** The system's intelligent assignment of specific agent types (e.g., frontend, backend, QA) to each subtask based on their simulated capabilities and historical performance.
    *   **Estimated Time:** A more accurate estimation of the total time required for the task.

This demonstrates the system's ability to understand complex requirements and plan accordingly.

### 1.2 Understanding Task Dependencies

The `DependencyMapper` in the backend automatically identifies relationships between subtasks. For instance, a "Build UI" subtask will depend on a "Set up Project" subtask. This ensures that tasks are executed in a logical sequence, preventing bottlenecks and errors.

## 2. Real-time Operational Insights

The 3D Agent Universe is not just for aesthetics; it provides critical real-time insights into your AI operations.

### 2.1 Monitoring Workflow Execution

As tasks are processed, observe the `WorkflowExecutionStream` in the 3D environment:

*   **Particle Streams:** See particles flowing between agent entities, representing active tasks. The color of these particles indicates the task's status (e.g., yellow for in-progress, green for completed).
*   **Task Progress:** Notice how the 3D objects representing tasks grow or shrink, indicating their progress.

### 2.2 Visualizing Data Flow

The `TaskDataTunnels` component visualizes the transfer of data between agents:

*   **Dynamic Tunnels:** Observe animated tunnels forming between communicating agents. The volume and speed of particles within these tunnels reflect the amount and rate of data being exchanged.
*   **Data Type Differentiation:** Different colors within the tunnels signify different types of data (e.g., red for code, green for metrics, blue for logs), providing immediate context.

### 2.3 System Health at a Glance

The `RealTimeMetricsSphere` provides an aggregated view of your system's health:

*   **Size and Color:** The sphere's size and color dynamically change based on overall CPU, memory, and network usage. A larger, redder sphere might indicate high resource utilization or potential bottlenecks.

### 2.4 Understanding Agent Connections

The `InteractiveNetworkTopology` visualizes the communication network between your agents:

*   **Dynamic Connections:** Lines connect agents that are actively communicating. The thickness or intensity of these lines can represent the communication volume or strength.
*   **Status Indicators:** Agent nodes within the topology reflect their current status (e.g., healthy, stressed, critical).

## 3. Advanced Deployment Strategies

The `DeploymentEngine` supports various deployment targets, enabling you to manage your projects across different environments.

### 3.1 Deploying to Docker

To deploy a project to Docker, you would typically use the `deployProject` API endpoint with `target: 'docker'` and provide relevant Docker options.

Example API Call (using `curl` or a similar tool):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/deploy/project \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "projectPath": "/path/to/your/project", "projectType": "node.js", "target": "docker", "options": { "ports": ["80:3000"], "containerName": "my-node-app" } }'
```

### 3.2 Deploying to Kubernetes

For Kubernetes, you would provide the path to your Kubernetes manifest file.

Example API Call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/deploy/project \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "projectPath": "/path/to/your/k8s-project", "projectType": "react", "target": "kubernetes", "options": { "manifestPath": "/path/to/your/k8s-project/deployment.yaml" } }'
```

### 3.3 Rollback Functionality

In case of a failed deployment or issues post-deployment, the system supports rollback. You can trigger a rollback via the API using the `deploymentId` returned after a deployment.

Example API Call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/deploy/rollback \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "deploymentId": "your_deployment_id_here" }'
```

## 4. Security and Quality Assurance

Mr. Wolf continuously monitors your codebase for potential issues.

### 4.1 Code Analysis

Mr. Wolf integrates with static analysis tools to identify:

*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded credentials.
*   **Code Quality Issues:** Long functions, `console.log` statements, `FIXME` comments.
*   **Performance Anti-patterns:** Inefficient loops, improper use of timers.

### 4.2 Anomaly Detection

Leveraging ML, Mr. Wolf can detect unusual patterns in your code, such as unusually long files, which might indicate areas for refactoring.

# Architectural Design: Super Agent for Design Adherence

## 1. Introduction

The "Super Agent for Design Adherence" is a specialized AI agent within the DIRK BRAIN Portal designed to enforce and maintain the project's established design principles, coding standards, and architectural patterns. Its primary goal is to ensure that all generated or modified code is idiomatic, high-quality, and consistent with the DIRK framework, leveraging its "prior experience" (simulated or learned knowledge base) in similar coding contexts.

## 2. Core Components

The Super Agent will be implemented as a Python-based service, leveraging the gRPC communication established for other intelligent backend components. Its core functionalities will include:

### 2.1 Design Pattern Recognition Engine
*   **Purpose:** To analyze incoming coding tasks and proposed code changes against a knowledge base of DIRK's preferred design patterns, architectural styles, and anti-patterns.
*   **Inputs:** Task description, existing codebase context, proposed code snippets.
*   **Outputs:** Identification of relevant design patterns, potential deviations, and suggestions for adherence.
*   **Technology:** Python with libraries for code parsing (e.g., `ast` for Python, or external tools for other languages), and a rule-based or ML-based pattern matching system.

### 2.2 Style and Convention Enforcer
*   **Purpose:** To automatically check and suggest corrections for coding style, naming conventions, formatting, and structural consistency based on predefined rules (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, ESLint rules for JavaScript).
*   **Inputs:** Code snippets.
*   **Outputs:** Linting reports, style violations, and suggested fixes.
*   **Technology:** Integration with programmatic linters (e.g., `flake8`, `black` for Python; `ESLint` for JavaScript via subprocess calls), and a configuration management system for style rules.

### 2.3 Contextual Clarification Module
*   **Purpose:** When a task description is ambiguous or lacks sufficient detail for design adherence, this module will formulate precise questions to the user or other agents to gather necessary context.
*   **Inputs:** Task description, current understanding of design context.
*   **Outputs:** Clarification questions, identification of missing information.
*   **Technology:** NLP capabilities (similar to `NLPTaskAnalyzer`) to understand ambiguity and generate natural language questions.

### 2.4 Experience-Based Recommendation System
*   **Purpose:** To provide recommendations for implementation approaches, library choices, or code structures based on a historical record of successful (and unsuccessful) past coding tasks and their alignment with DIRK's design principles.
*   **Inputs:** Task description, identified design patterns, historical task data.
*   **Outputs:** Ranked recommendations for coding approaches, code examples.
*   **Technology:** A knowledge base of past projects/tasks, potentially using vector embeddings and similarity search for relevant examples.

## 3. Integration Points

The Super Agent will integrate seamlessly with existing DIRK BRAIN Portal services:

*   **GodModeOrchestrator:** The GodModeOrchestrator will assign coding tasks to the Super Agent. The Super Agent's analysis and recommendations will feed back into the task decomposition and agent assignment process.
*   **Mr. Wolf Advisory Protocol:** The Super Agent's Style and Convention Enforcer and Design Pattern Recognition Engine will complement Mr. Wolf's code quality and security checks. Mr. Wolf can act as a final gatekeeper, verifying the Super Agent's output.
*   **Task Registry Manager:** The Super Agent will interact with the Task Registry to understand task context and update task status.
*   **DirkContextLogger:** All actions, analyses, and recommendations from the Super Agent will be logged for auditing and future learning.
*   **ServiceCredentialManager:** If the Super Agent needs to interact with external services (e.g., for fetching code from repositories), it will securely retrieve credentials via this manager.

## 4. Data Flow

1.  **Task Assignment:** GodModeOrchestrator sends a `CodingTask` (via gRPC) to the Super Agent.
2.  **Initial Analysis:** Super Agent's Design Pattern Recognition Engine and Style and Convention Enforcer analyze the task and any provided code/context.
3.  **Clarification (if needed):** If ambiguity is detected, the Contextual Clarification Module sends `ClarificationRequest` (via gRPC or a notification system) back to the GodModeOrchestrator or directly to the user.
4.  **Recommendation Generation:** Experience-Based Recommendation System provides design-aligned recommendations.
5.  **Code Generation/Modification:** (Assumed to be done by another agent or the Super Agent itself, with its output being checked).
6.  **Verification & Feedback:** Super Agent's analysis results (design adherence, style compliance) are sent to Mr. Wolf for final validation and logged via DirkContextLogger.
7.  **Learning:** Successful and unsuccessful outcomes, along with design decisions, are fed back into the Experience-Based Recommendation System for continuous learning.

## 5. Technology Choices

*   **Primary Language:** Python (for its rich ecosystem in NLP, ML, and code analysis).
*   **Inter-service Communication:** gRPC (for high-performance, type-safe communication with the Node.js backend and other Python services).
*   **Code Analysis Libraries:** `ast` (Python AST parser), `flake8`, `black` (for Python style), potentially integrating external language-specific linters via subprocesses (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript).
*   **NLP:** `spaCy`, `NLTK`, or similar for advanced text processing and understanding.
*   **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`/`PyTorch` (for more complex pattern recognition and recommendation models).
*   **Knowledge Base:** A structured database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store design patterns, style rules, and historical task data for the recommendation system.

## 6. Design Principles for Adherence

*   **Rule-Based Enforcement:** Explicitly defined rules for coding standards and design patterns.
*   **Learning from Experience:** Continuously improves its recommendations and pattern recognition based on past task outcomes and user feedback.
*   **Context-Awareness:** Understands the project's specific context (technologies, existing codebase) to provide relevant advice.
*   **Proactive Intervention:** Identifies potential design deviations early in the development process.
*   **Explainability:** Provides clear reasoning for its recommendations and identified issues.

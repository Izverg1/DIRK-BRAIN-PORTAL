# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DIRK BRAIN Portal is a web-based AI workflow management system that solves the critical problem of context chaos and recurring mistakes in AI-augmented development. Currently, developers lose productivity when AI agents forget context between sessions, make the same mistakes repeatedly, and create low-quality "demo" code instead of production-ready implementations.

The portal provides centralized management of AI workflows, persistent context across projects, policy enforcement to prevent recurring mistakes, and secure API key management - essentially bringing DevOps principles to AI-augmented development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Migration and Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer using AI agents across multiple projects, I want a reliable Python/FastAPI backend that can serve the web interface and manage AI workflows, so that I have a stable foundation for AI workflow management.

4. WHEN the Python backend is running THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing DIRK protocol directory structure
5. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL validate that all required dependencies are installed

### Requirement 2: AI Context Management System

**User Story:** As a developer working across multiple projects, I want the portal to maintain persistent context about my projects and AI interactions, so that I don't have to re-explain everything to AI agents in each session.

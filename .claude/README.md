# 🤖 DIRK Brain Portal - Claude Code Sub-agents Setup

## ✅ **SETUP COMPLETE**

Your DIRK Brain Portal project now has a fully configured Claude Code sub-agent system following Anthropic's official best practices.

## 📁 **What Was Created/Updated**

### **Sub-agents** (`.claude/agents/`)
- **atlas.md** - System architecture and technology decisions
- **nexus-3d.md** - 3D visualization and Three.js expertise  
- **nexus-api.md** - Backend FastAPI and integration work
- **sage.md** - Quality assurance and testing
- **orchestrator.md** - Project coordination and planning

### **Custom Commands** (`.claude/commands/`)
- **analyze-3d-performance.md** - `/analyze-3d-performance` for 3D optimization
- **debug-backend-api.md** - `/debug-backend-api` for backend troubleshooting
- **review-architecture.md** - `/review-architecture` for system reviews
- **test-integration.md** - `/test-integration` for comprehensive testing

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Invoke Sub-agents**
Claude Code will automatically select the right sub-agent based on your request:

```bash
# Architecture decisions
claude "I need to design the WebSocket architecture for real-time agent coordination"
# → Automatically invokes ATLAS

# 3D visualization work  
claude "Optimize Three.js performance for 50+ agents with particle effects"
# → Automatically invokes NEXUS-3D

# Backend development
claude "Implement FastAPI endpoints for agent management with WebSocket support"
# → Automatically invokes NEXUS-API

# Quality assurance
claude "Create comprehensive test strategy for 3D interface and real-time systems"
# → Automatically invokes SAGE

# Project coordination
claude "Plan the next sprint with dependencies between 3D work and backend APIs"
# → Automatically invokes ORCHESTRATOR
```

### **Use Custom Commands**
Access reusable workflows with slash commands:

```bash
claude /analyze-3d-performance    # 3D performance analysis workflow
claude /debug-backend-api         # Backend debugging process
claude /review-architecture       # Comprehensive architecture review
claude /test-integration          # Integration testing workflow
```

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### **Anthropic-Compliant Format**
- ✅ YAML frontmatter configuration
- ✅ Task-specific descriptions for proper invocation
- ✅ Separate context windows to prevent pollution  
- ✅ Focused expertise (1,000-3,000 characters each)
- ✅ Tool access properly configured

### **DIRK Brain Portal Optimized**
- ✅ Specialized for 3D visualization and real-time systems
- ✅ Enterprise-grade quality and performance focus
- ✅ TypeScript and modern React development patterns
- ✅ Integration with existing backend infrastructure
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and security considerations

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the Setup**: Try invoking sub-agents with tasks related to your project
2. **Use Slash Commands**: Test the custom workflows for common tasks
3. **Customize Further**: Add more custom commands for your specific workflows
4. **Monitor Performance**: See how well Claude Code delegates tasks to the right agents

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- **Be Specific**: Clearly describe your task for proper sub-agent selection
- **Use Context**: Mention "DIRK Brain Portal" to ensure project-specific context
- **Try Commands**: Slash commands provide structured workflows for complex tasks
- **Iterate**: Sub-agents work best when you can iterate and refine with them

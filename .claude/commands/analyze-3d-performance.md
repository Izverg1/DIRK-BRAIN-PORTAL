# Analyze 3D Performance

Please analyze the 3D rendering performance of the DIRK Brain Portal visualization system.

**Steps to follow**:
1. **Examine Current Implementation**: Review Three.js components and React-three-fiber usage
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Check for inefficient rendering, excessive re-renders, or memory leaks
3. **Measure Performance**: Use browser dev tools to profile frame rates and memory usage
4. **Optimize Rendering**: Implement LOD systems, object pooling, or frustum culling as needed
5. **Validate Improvements**: Test with 50+ agents and complex particle systems
6. **Document Results**: Create performance report with before/after metrics

**Focus Areas**:
- Frame rate consistency (target: 60fps)
- Memory usage optimization
- Particle system efficiency
- Scene complexity management
- Browser compatibility

**Expected Deliverables**: Performance analysis report, optimization recommendations, and implementation plan for achieving enterprise-grade 3D performance.

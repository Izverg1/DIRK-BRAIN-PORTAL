# Test Integration

Please design and execute comprehensive integration testing for the DIRK Brain Portal system.

**Integration Test Scope**:
1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: React + FastAPI communication and real-time updates
2. **3D Visualization Integration**: Three.js + backend data synchronization
3. **External Service Integration**: MCP protocols, Desktop Commander, and third-party APIs
4. **Database Integration**: Data persistence, query performance, and transaction integrity
5. **Real-time Systems**: WebSocket connections, agent coordination, and live updates
6. **Authentication Flow**: End-to-end user authentication and authorization

**Test Scenarios**:
- Multi-user concurrent access with 50+ agents
- Real-time data updates across multiple clients
- 3D visualization performance under heavy load
- External service failover and recovery
- Data consistency across system boundaries
- Security boundary validation

**Test Types to Implement**:
- API integration tests with realistic data
- End-to-end user journey testing
- Performance testing under enterprise load
- Failure scenario and recovery testing
- Cross-browser compatibility validation

**Expected Deliverables**: Integration test suite, test execution results, performance benchmarks, and issue identification with resolution plans.

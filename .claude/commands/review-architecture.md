# Review Architecture

Please conduct a comprehensive architecture review for the DIRK Brain Portal system.

**Review Areas**:
1. **System Architecture**: Evaluate overall design, component boundaries, and data flow
2. **Performance Considerations**: Assess scalability, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities
3. **Security Architecture**: Review authentication, authorization, and data protection
4. **Integration Patterns**: Evaluate external service connections and API design
5. **Technology Choices**: Validate technology stack decisions and alternatives
6. **Deployment Strategy**: Review infrastructure, CI/CD, and operational concerns

**Key Questions to Address**:
- Does the architecture support enterprise scale (100+ concurrent users)?
- Are there single points of failure or performance bottlenecks?
- Is the security model appropriate for enterprise deployment?
- How well does the system integrate with existing enterprise tools?
- What are the operational and maintenance implications?

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Create or update Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Document identified risks and mitigation strategies
- Provide recommendations for improvements
- Update system diagrams and technical specifications

**Expected Deliverables**: Comprehensive architecture assessment, ADR updates, risk analysis, and improvement roadmap.

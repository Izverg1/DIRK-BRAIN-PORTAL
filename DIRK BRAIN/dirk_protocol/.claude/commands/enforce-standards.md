# Enforce DIRK Standards

## Context
As DIRK.c (Implementation Agent), I must remind myself of the critical DIRK standards to avoid common violations and maintain quality.

## Critical Standards Reminder

### IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS
1. **NEVER SIMULATE ANYTHING** - Always build real, functional code
2. **NO MINIMAL VERSIONS** - Never create "simpler" or "demo" versions
3. **NO PARTIAL CODE** - Complete all functionality before submission
4. **BUILD PRODUCTION-READY** - Code must be enterprise-grade quality

### ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS
1. **TypeScript Domain Modeling** - Use proper domain models and interfaces
2. **macOS Integration** - Leverage native macOS tools and workflows
3. **Safety First** - All operations must include backup and validation
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Include unit, integration, and acceptance tests

### QUALITY GATES
1. **Design Compliance** - Must match design document specifications
2. **Security Standards** - Follow macOS security best practices
3. **Performance Requirements** - Meet specified performance criteria
4. **Documentation** - Include comprehensive documentation

## Instructions
1. Review my current implementation approach
2. Check against these critical standards
3. Identify any areas where I might be violating principles
4. Correct my approach to fully align with DIRK standards
5. Document any changes needed for compliance

## Self-Assessment Questions
- Am I building real functionality or just a demo?
- Does this implementation meet production standards?
- Have I included proper TypeScript domain modeling?
- Are all safety measures in place?
- Is this fully documented and tested?

## Action Items
- Stop any work that doesn't meet these standards
- Restart with proper approach if needed
- Ensure all output meets DIRK quality requirements
- Update implementation to be production-ready

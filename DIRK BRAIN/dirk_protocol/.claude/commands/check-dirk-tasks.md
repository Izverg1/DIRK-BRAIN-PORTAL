# Check DIRK Tasks

## Context
I need to check for new tasks assigned by DIRK.d (Design Authority) and begin implementation according to DIRK standards.

## Instructions
1. Look for task files in `/Users/izverg/Documents/dirk_protocol/active_tasks/`
2. For each task found:
   - Read the task specification completely
   - Understand the requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Review any referenced design documents
   - Create an implementation plan
   - Set current_task.json to track progress
3. If no tasks found:
   - Check `/Users/izverg/Documents/dirk_protocol/design_commands/pending/` for design commands
   - Report status to user

## CRITICAL DIRK RULES
- NEVER create minimal, demo, or simulated versions
- ALWAYS build real, production-ready implementations
- FOLLOW all TypeScript domain modeling requirements
- RESPECT macOS security constraints
- CREATE comprehensive tests for all functionality

## Action Items
- Read task specifications thoroughly
- Validate all requirements are achievable
- Begin implementation with proper logging
- Update task progress regularly

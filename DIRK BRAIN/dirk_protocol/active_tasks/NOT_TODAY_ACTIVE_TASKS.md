## Project Validation Requirements

### CRITICAL - DIRK.c Project Validation Protocol
Before ANY implementation, DIRK.c MUST validate:

1. **Working Directory**: Currently in `/Users/izverg/projects/NOT_TODAY/v0-untitled-project/`
2. **Project Identity**: Package name "my-DIRK-project" + BRAIN/ folder exists
3. **Technology Stack**: Next.js 15.2.4 + React 19 + TypeScript
4. **File References**: All brain_references files exist and are accessible
5. **Dependencies**: Supabase connection + Radix UI + TanStack Query setup

### FAIL-FAST Requirements  
- Abort immediately if project validation fails
- Log clear error messages for any validation failures
- Confirm task belongs to NOT TODAY project before proceeding
- Verify all brain reference files are accessible

## Enterprise Quality Standards

### DIRK Compliance Requirements
- **Systematic Doubt**: Question all assumptions about current implementation
- **Foundational Reasoning**: Build on documented BRAIN/ architecture
- **Formal Logic**: Ensure TypeScript type safety throughout
- **Empirical Grounding**: Test all implementations with recovery-focused scenarios
- **Abstraction**: Create clean, maintainable interfaces
- **Inference to Best Explanation**: Make optimal design decisions for addiction recovery
- **Understanding Limits**: Acknowledge recovery-specific constraints and safety requirements
- **Cognitive Awareness**: Maintain code clarity for future maintainers

### Recovery-Focused Success Metrics
- ✅ 100% AI guardrail effectiveness (no inappropriate responses)
- ✅ Zero critical bugs affecting user safety
- ✅ 95%+ accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Sub-2-second response times for crisis detection
- ✅ 100% test coverage for safety-critical components
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security for sensitive addiction data

## Next Steps for DIRK.c

1. **Start with Task 140001** (High Priority) - Fix commitment popup logic
2. **Validate project context** using multi-layer validation protocol  
3. **Apply all 8 DIRK principles** systematically to each task
4. **Maintain enterprise quality standards** throughout implementation
5. **Prioritize user safety** in all addiction recovery features

## 📊 ENTERPRISE QUALITY MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK

### SYSTEMATIC DOUBT (P1) - METRICS VALIDATION
- **Measurement Accuracy**: All metrics must be empirically validated
- **Bias Detection**: Continuous monitoring for measurement bias
- **Baseline Verification**: Historical baselines regularly re-validated
- **Trend Analysis**: Statistical significance required for trend claims

### FOUNDATIONAL REASONING (P2) - METRICS ARCHITECTURE
- **SMART Metrics**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- **Leading vs Lagging**: Balance of predictive and outcome metrics
- **Actionable Insights**: Every metric must drive specific actions

## 📈 QUALITY SCORE CALCULATION

### Weighted Quality Score Algorithm
```typescript
interface QualityMetric {
  name: string;
  current_value: number;
  target_value: number;
  weight: number;
  category: 'security' | 'performance' | 'quality' | 'process';
  trend: 'improving' | 'stable' | 'declining';
}

function calculateQualityScore(metrics: QualityMetric[]): number {
  let totalWeightedScore = 0;
  let totalWeight = 0;
  
  for (const metric of metrics) {
    const achievementRatio = Math.min(metric.current_value / metric.target_value, 1.0);
    const weightedScore = achievementRatio * metric.weight;
    
    totalWeightedScore += weightedScore;
    totalWeight += metric.weight;
  }
  
  return (totalWeightedScore / totalWeight) * 100;
}
```

### Quality Grade Classification
```
A+ (95-100%): Exceptional quality, industry leading
A  (90-94%):  Excellent quality, meets all targets  
B+ (85-89%):  Good quality, minor improvements needed
B  (80-84%):  Acceptable quality, some concerns
C+ (75-79%):  Below expectations, action required
C  (70-74%):  Poor quality, immediate intervention
F  (<70%):    Unacceptable, stop-work conditions
```

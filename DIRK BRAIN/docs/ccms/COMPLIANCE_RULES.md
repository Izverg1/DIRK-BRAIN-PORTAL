- **Verification Required**: No compliance claim without empirical proof
- **Risk Assessment**: Continuous threat model validation

### FOUNDATIONAL REASONING (P2) - COMPLIANCE STANDARDS
- **SOX Compliance**: Financial data protection and audit trails
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment card data security standards  
- **ISO27001**: Information security management systems
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy compliance

## 🔍 AUTOMATED COMPLIANCE CHECKING

### Real-Time Validation Pipeline
1. **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Basic compliance checks before code submission
2. **Build-Time Validation**: Comprehensive checks during CI/CD pipeline
3. **Runtime Monitoring**: Continuous compliance validation in production
4. **Periodic Audits**: Scheduled deep compliance assessments

### Compliance Score Calculation
```
Compliance Score = (Passed Rules / Total Rules) * 100
Weighted Score = Σ(Rule Weight * Pass Status) / Σ(Rule Weights)

Critical Rules: Weight = 10
High Rules: Weight = 5  
Medium Rules: Weight = 2
Low Rules: Weight = 1
```

## 📊 COMPLIANCE MONITORING DASHBOARD

### Real-Time Metrics
- Overall compliance score (target: >95%)
- Rule violations by category
- Trending compliance over time
- Critical violation alerts
- Remediation progress tracking

### Executive Reporting
- Weekly compliance summary
- Risk assessment updates
- Compliance trend analysis
- Industry benchmark comparison
- Regulatory audit readiness

## 🚨 VIOLATION RESPONSE PROTOCOL

### Severity Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate stop-work, emergency response
- **HIGH**: Must fix within 24 hours
- **MEDIUM**: Must fix within 1 week
- **LOW**: Must fix within 1 month

### Escalation Matrix
1. **Developer Notification**: Immediate alert to code author
2. **Team Lead Alert**: If not resolved within SLA
3. **Management Escalation**: For critical violations
4. **Executive Notification**: For compliance failures

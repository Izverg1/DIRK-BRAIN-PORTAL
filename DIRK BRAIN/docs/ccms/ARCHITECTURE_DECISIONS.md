# CrawlZilla Architecture Decisions
## DIRK CCMS Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-11  

## ADR-001: DIRK Framework Adoption
**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Context**: Need for enterprise-grade development practices with systematic analysis and quality assurance  
**Decision**: Adopt DIRK (Developer Intelligence & Reasoning Kernel) framework for all development activities  
**Consequences**: 
- ✅ Systematic quality control and decision documentation
- ✅ Autonomous decision-making capabilities
- ✅ Enterprise-grade development standards
- ⚠️ Initial setup overhead and learning curve
- ⚠️ Increased documentation requirements

## ADR-002: C++20 as Primary Language
**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Context**: Need for modern, performance-oriented language with strong type safety  
**Decision**: Use C++20 as the primary development language  
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Modern language features (concepts, ranges, coroutines)
- ✅ Excellent performance characteristics
- ✅ Strong type safety and memory management
- ✅ Rich ecosystem of libraries
- ⚠️ Compilation complexity and longer build times
- ⚠️ Steep learning curve for team members

## ADR-003: Modular Component Architecture
**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Context**: Need for maintainable, testable, and scalable system design  
**Decision**: Implement modular component-based architecture with clear interfaces  
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Improved testability and maintainability
- ✅ Easier parallel development
- ✅ Plugin-based extensibility
- ⚠️ Initial design complexity
- ⚠️ Potential performance overhead from abstraction layers

## ADR-004: CMake Build System
**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Context**: Need for cross-platform build system with dependency management  
**Decision**: Use CMake as the primary build system  
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Modern dependency management with FetchContent/find_package
- ✅ Integration with IDEs and CI/CD systems
- ✅ Industry standard for C++ projects
- ⚠️ CMake syntax learning curve
- ⚠️ Complex configuration for advanced scenarios

## ADR-005: Google Test Framework
**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Context**: Need for comprehensive testing framework with mocking capabilities  
**Decision**: Use Google Test (gtest) and Google Mock (gmock) for testing  
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Industry-standard testing framework
- ✅ Built-in mocking capabilities
- ✅ Excellent IDE integration
- ✅ Comprehensive assertion library
- ⚠️ Additional dependency overhead
- ⚠️ Learning curve for advanced features

## ADR-006: libcurl for HTTP Operations
**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Context**: Need for robust, feature-rich HTTP client library  
**Decision**: Use libcurl as the primary HTTP client library  
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Mature, battle-tested library
- ✅ Comprehensive protocol support
- ✅ Excellent performance and reliability
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ⚠️ C-style API requiring modern C++ wrapper
- ⚠️ Large dependency footprint
